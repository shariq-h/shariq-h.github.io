    <p>As AI becomes more and more advanced and efficient, it's uses in the world are hard to miss. Today's AI able to think and process information at speeds faster than ever before, and becoming almost indistinguishable from manmade results. However, even our most advanced AI still hasn't become sentient, to the surprise of some. There is no definite definition of sentience by which we can check an AI for. Research Robert Long from the Future for Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford says that sentience "involves the capacity to feel pleasure or pain" (Dinh, 2022). Others say that for an AI to be sentient, it must "be able to think, perceive, and feel" (Shah, 2022).</p>

    <h2>Will a Sentient AI have a positive or negative impact</h2>
    <p>However, if we ever do create a sentient AI, will it benefit or harm our current society? Our current complex AI is already subject to criticism and controversy against AI replacing human worker's jobs. Another relatively new problem is the spread of misinformation using AI generated text or even photos. When these AI's are connected to chatbots, they can "operate at a scale that makes today's human-driven disinformation campaigns seem minuscule by comparison" (Metz, 2022). A sentient AI would have its own conscious that could decide what it should or shouldn't do. But then again, should the AI's conscience override a humans? For sentient AI to contribute to a postive utopia, there must be a system that accounts for both malicious AI and humans. If we were to control the morals or conscience of the AI, the AI wouldn't be sentient. Instead, the AI should be kept safely and secure so that only trusted individuals can use it. OpenAI's "GPT-3" already has the ability to create realistic images depicting what the user wants (Metz, 2022). A malicious user could easily use this open source to create any image they want to mislead people. With a theoretical sentient AI, the possibilities are exponetially more complex. In the hands of a malicious user, the sentient AI could be used for anything even if the AI recognizes the task as immoral, since humans must have a fail-safe override.</p>
    <p>Even guarding the sentient AI and manually filtering who gets to use the AI still doesn't solve the issue since anyone can develop a sentient AI. People with malicious intent could always replicate the sentient AI to complete their tasks. There is virtually no way to completely protect the AI from malicious users, nor can we rely on the AI to judge the ethics of each request. Therefore, AI Sentience alone can't lead to a perfect utopia or a doomed dystopia; that lies on the intent of the user. Sentient AI is just like any other technology: a tool. It can be used for whatever purpose the user wants. It's up to society to create laws and regulations to prevent people from using those tools for a negative cause.</p>
