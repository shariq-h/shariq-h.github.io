    <p>Decision making is a complex process that requires a person to consider various options and choose the most appropriate one. With every stimulus, we have a choice on how to react and choose our reactions, which influence the future indefinitely. However, the process of decision making isn't always done correctly and can be affected by bias. Bias is defined as an inclination to a certain outlook or essentially prejudice towards a certain outcome (Merriam-Webster, n.d.). Instead of making an informed decision, we may be biased towards certain factors. By being aware of these biases and taking steps to compensate for them, people can make better, more rational decisions.</p>
    <p>Confirmation bias is a type of cognitive bias that happens when people only look for and pay attention to information that confirms their existing beliefs or ideas. This can result in a biased interpretation of evidence and leading to skewed decision making.</p>
    <p>Conservatism bias is a cognitive bias that occurs when individuals underestimate the likelihood of a positive event occurring and overestimate the likelihood of a negative event occurring. This can lead to inadequate decision-making and suboptimal outcomes. For example, when presented with a new investment opportunity, individuals with conservatism bias may overestimate the likelihood of the investment failing and underestimate the likelihood of it succeeding, leading them to avoid the investment altogether. Conservatism bias can be a result of various factors, including a lack of information or experience and a general tendency towards caution. It is important for individuals to be aware of this bias and take steps to avoid it when making decisions.<p>
    <p>Framing bias is a type of bias that occurs when individuals interpret information in a way that is influenced by the way it is presented. Through certain wording or framing the same information can influence the conclusion the viewer concludes. For example, In a 1982 study by Barbare McNeil, Stephen Pauker, Harold Sox, and Amos Tversky, the results of surgery and radiation cancer treatment were shown to 238 patients, 491 graduate students, and 424 physicians. The data presented was either shown in terms of the probability of living vs the probability of dying. Their results found that participants were more likely to choose surgery over radiation therapy when the treatments were identified to them and when the data was presented in terms of life expectancy (McNeil et al., 1982). Even though the the data presented to the two groups had the exact same statistics, because the data was framed by life expectancy vs probability of dying, more participants were attracted to surgery when they were told that 34 out of 100 patients were alive at the end of 5 years after surgery rather than 66/100 die by the end of 5 years after the surgery.</p>    
    <p>Sampling bias when a sample of people doesn't accurately represent the population. The Law of Large Numbers states that as the amount of trials increases, the percentage between the expected and actual value approaches zero (Renze et al., n.d.). In sampling, each additional person to sample size, or increase in <i>n</i> acts as another trial of the procedure. Thus, the higher <i>n</i>, or sample size, the more accurate the results will be. In addition, Nisbett et al. (1983) showed that people were more likely to use statistical heuristics, or rough intuitive equivalents of statistical principles, when the sample space & sampling process were more clear, the role of chance is clear, and when the culture specifies that statisitical reasoning is normative for the event. When people are made aware of the statical nature of a work, they are more likely to implement statistical concepts from intuition onto their results. Sedlmeier et al. (1997) attempted to test whether the Law of Large Numbers was intuitively found in humans. They found that one group of studies showed that participants were attentive to sample size, whereas another group found participants ignoring it. Sedlmeier et al. (1997) suggested that the inconsitency of these findings were because human intuition did conform to the "empirical law of large numbers", but also distinguished tasks into frquency distributuions (ones that could be solved through intuition of the law of large numbers) and sampling distributions (ones that can't be solved through that intuition). Sampling bias has to be tken into account when testing a product. If you suvery the product response to a small sample size, you may by chance pick people who like the product, when the true population doesn't. By having a larger sample size, the more likely it is that your sample's response aligns with the population's response.</p>
    <p>Testimony bias occurs when someone inability to recall a memory perfectly causes them to logically recontruct it, which may be inaccurate. Testimony bias is a result of using cues from post fact information. If a person knows the outcome or the expected outcome, if they don't accurately remember the memory, they can logically recontruct a memory that aligns with the outcome. Hogarth (1987) demonstrated testimony bias by asking participants questions about a car accident. Hogarth (1987) reported different speed estimates based on whether the participant was asked "How fast were the cars travelling when they <i>hit</i>" versus "How fast were the cars travelling when they <i>smashed</i>". Based on the structure of the question, the participants were given clues that supported an outcome. An example of testimonial bias is during a survey rather than asking which of two options one prefers, instead the interviewer asks whether the person likes one over the other. By setting up question like "Do you like x over y?", option x seems like the main comparison point of the survey rather than preferance.</p>
