	  <h1>ISP Proposal</h1>
	  <h2>Identity</h2>
	  <p>Spotify is one of the most popular music apps that allows users to stream music on their device.</p>
	  <h2>Problem</h2>
	  <p>Spotify's UI is inconsistent between PC and iOS App and many features like syncing play don't work correctly. Spotify also doesn't let you see your streams data or export it easily.</p>
	  <h2>My Solution</h2>
	  <p>My app allows people to sync and listen to music together by connecting to their spotify account's and automatically updating all devices with the current song and timestamp, so they play from the same time on each device. In addition, my app would track streams using Spotify API and log them under the user's account. The users could then see their data and sort for their most streamed songs, artists, etc.</p>
	  <h2>The Competiton</h2>
	  <p>There are other websites, independent from Spotify, that allow you to connect your Spotify account and view simillar statistics. However, their models only allow you to view to top 10 to 50 entries of artist or song between certain time periods, like 4 weeks, or 6 months. My application would track the user;s streaming data, so a user could view/compare their statisitcs from the past, as well as export their data to connect to other applications that would want to use streaming data.</p>
	  <h2>Revenue streams</h2>
	  <p>My app will gain revenue through unobtrusive ads on the website/app.</p>
	  <h2>Marketing Actvities</h2>
	  <p>We will mostly market through social media, since social media users are likely to be closer to  our target audience</p>
	  <h2>Expenses</h2>
	  <p>Our only expenses would be a website domain to host the application. Once we finish the main website, we may need to submit approval for an iOS app and a place to store our users data.</p>
	  <h2>Team</h2>
	  <p>There is currently only one member, me.</p>
	  <h2>Milestones</h2>
