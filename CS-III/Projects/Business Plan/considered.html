	<h1>ISP Acceptance</h1>
	
	<div class="row">
	  <div class="column">
	    <h2>Foob</h2>
	    <name>faraz-piracha</name>
	  </div>
	  <div class="column">
	    <p>I think that the idea of Foob is useful as it has a practical use in real life. I have heard of simillar programs before so the idea isn't necessarily new. Ultimately, I dedicded not to join this project since I have limited knowledge of cooking in general, so I do not think I bring any unique knowledge to the project.</p>

	    <h2>Eagle Eats</h2>
	    <name>shivanshi-das</name>
	  </div>
	  <div class="column">
	    <p>I really like this idea since the high school lunch lines are excessively long and people towards the end of the line usually don't have time to finish their food. This system would allow students to order in advance, and pick up the food, reudicng time spent in lined. Ultimately, I decided to not go with this idea, since integration with the whole school would be very difficult to be done properly. There would be a high volume of users and any mistakes can cause real problems with student's lunch money, etc. This ISP also depends on whether the school even gives us permission to implement it.</p>

	    <h2>Time Management App</h2>
	    <name>ishita-chowdhury</name>
	  </div>
	  <div class="column">
	    <p>I like this idea since I think time managment is a big skill that most high school students ignore. Most time management apps I have seen are not very motivating or helpful. I like the idea of adding usable pomedero timers and a sticky note type UI where the project feels like a virtual desk which students are working at. I ultimately decided upon this ISP and joined this team.</p>

	<div class="row">
	  <div class="column">
	    <h2>Extracurricular Social Media</h2>
	    <name>evan-bowerman</name>
	  </div>
	  <div class="column">
	    <p>This idea is a social media service for extracurricular school activities like tutoring and clubs. I like this idea since it has real life capabilities and can be implemented at Allen High School. It would help organize activities so clubs won't schedule meetings at the same time and can help people looking for extracurriculars more easily.</p>

	<div class="row">
	  <div class="column">
	    <h2>ID Scan Attendance</h2>
	    <name>hamza-ebeida</name>
	  </div>
	  <div class="column">
	    <p>This project is an automatic attendance app, allowing students to scan ID's one their way into class, as the app automatically counts them present. I like this project since it takes the real wolr dproblem of attendance which is very susceptible to human error, and automates it. Attendance will be more efficient and faster making it all around better.</p>

	  <div class="column">
	    <h2>Goose Simulater</h2>
	    <name>william-hutchings</name>
	  </div>
	  <div class="column">
	    <p>I like this idea since it is light hearted and has a simple comcept but sounds enjoyable. I ultimately decided against this one since I wanted to take on an ISP that helped solved a problem and could be implemented at Allen.</p>
	  </div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
	  <div class="column">
	    <h2>Productivity App</h2>
	    <name>danelle-corbita</name>
	  </div>
	  <div class="column">
	    <p>I like the concept of this project since it helps people stay organized and productive by stating there tasks and alloting time to each one. However, I didn't see enough detail on how the project wanted to achieve these goals which is why I ultimately decided against it. This did lead me to my eventual final ISP which had a simillat concept but a plan to reach the end product.</p>

	<div class="row">
	  <div class="column">
	    <h2>Smartshop</h2>
	    <name>reynard-gunawan</name>
	  </div>
	  <div class="column">
	    <p>I like the concept of this project since it helps people find clothes suited to their style and body without having to venture from store to store only for them to not be able to find anything in their size. This app can also help local businesses gain more attention by showing their products to a wider audience. This app would make the process of shopping for clothes more efficient. However, a big downside I see is that this is already implemented on many major retailers' websites.</p>

	<div class="row">
	  <div class="column">
	    <h2>Castaway</h2>
	    <name>lilly-seeley</name>
	  </div>
	  <div class="column">
	    <p>Castaway is an app that allows users to create travel plans easily by planning your travel cost, time, distance, activities, food, and stay on one page. This idea helps plan out all aspects of traveling from one place. I eventually decided against this project since there are similar websites out there, that actually pull prices and deals from their own partnerships and APIs that we don’t have access to. Essentially this project won’t be as appealing as its competitors.</p>

	  <div class="column">
	    <h2>ShelterSafe</h2>
	    <name>onik-hoque</name>
	  </div>
	  <div class="column">
	    <p>ShelterSafe aims to eliminate the problem of lack of awareness regarding shelters by providing a hub that uses GPS signal to locate the user, and then uses cellular data to convey statistics from each nearby shelter concerning food supply, available space, and distance from each shelter. I like this project since it has a real world use and can save lives during natural disasters.</p>
