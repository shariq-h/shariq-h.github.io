    <p>The government should be involved with the regulation of AI, because the future of AI is unknown, and the abilities of AI haven't fully been understood yet. Since AI is being developed by independent private companies, the government should at least keep in talk with prominent tech companies working on AI capabilities. However, at this time, AI haesn't presented a direct threat that would require regulations from the government. However, society as a whole, will have to begin to account for the effects of AI and differentiating human made work from AI. Currently, the most concerning AI capability is deepfake technology, which allows someone to create a realistic video of a person saying anything someone wants. In the future, the legibility of any video or statement will need to be accurately verified to be authentic. This may be something that requires some regulation.</p>
