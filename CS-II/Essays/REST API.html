    <p>A REST API is an API, a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect and communicate with each other, based on the principles of REST, or representational state transfer (IBM, n.d.). The term REST refers to an architectural style that has 6 key constraints: uniform interface, client-server architecture, statelessness, cacheability, layered system, and code on demand (Gupta, 2021). Uniform interface refers to the APIs ability to fetch resources efficiently. Each resource should only have one logical way to be accessed as well as a way to fetch additional or related data. Client-server architecture refers to the individuality of the client and the server. The server should be able to independently evolve and update without dependency on the API and vice versa. The client should only use resource URLs from the API, and not depend on anything else from it. This allows for the servers and clients to be replaced without disrupting the other, assuming the new interface is similar (Gupta, 2021). Statelessness refers to the APIs ability to be stateless, or not store any information about the last request from the client, and instead treats every single request as new. This helps APIs by increasing performance by reducing server load from retaining server information, making them more ideal for high-volume applications (Wikipedia, n.d.). Cacheability refers to the idea that if an API is cacheable it must declare itself as cacheable. Caching is a system that optimizes the Web by downloading multiple copies of data in temporary storage to ensure that users don't have to redownload data every time they revisit an application or website (Gupta, 2021). By declaring cacheability, the API can specify if the data can be cached, which as a result, reduces the number of client-server interactions, improving performance (Wikipedia, n.d.). The layered system refers to if the API uses a layered architecture, or has data stored in one server, deploys the API on a different server, etc. In a REST API, a client shouldn't be able to tell whether it is connected to the end server or any other intermediary servers along the flow of information of the API. A layered system helps an API by making it easily scalable through by balancing the load of information between servers, and allows for security to be added as a layer on top, and allows intermediary servers to call on other servers to generate an output. In general, a layered system better organizes the API's code so that the load is balanced out between different servers running different code to all contribute to the response, enhancing performance (Gupta, 2021). The ability to code on-demand refers to the ability of REST APIs to extend the functionality and use of the API by transferring executable code, such as in compiled components like Java applets or client-side scripts like Javascript. This constraint is technically optional, as not every API is required to do so. (Wikipedia, n.d.).</p>
    <p>The term representational state transfer was first introduced in 2000 by Roy Fielding in his dissertation. Fielding highlighted the requirement for creating a "world-wide network-based application" by taking already existing architectural styles and identifying aspects that he believed should be considered central to the requirements of the Web (Wikipedia, n.d.). The term REST API refers to an API that follows the principles of REST.</p>
    <p>REST APIs are found throughout the Web. A notable example is Google's Gmail API, which calls itself a "RESTFul API" (Google, n.d.). REST APIs are also found commonly in video games since their core structures make them easily applicable in a game scenario. My sudoku code follows the principles of API by following the 6 constraints of REST APIs. This allows my Sudoku application to be more widely applicable and follow a standard.</p>
