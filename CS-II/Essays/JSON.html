    <p>JSON or JavaScript Object Notation is a data interchange and file format that is universal to many modern programming languages. JSON was derived from JavaScript, but is language independent but uses common programming conventions that are familiar from the C-family of programming languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, Javascript, Perl, Python, and others. Its universal use is often credited to its ability to be easily written by humans, and easy for computers to process and generate, unlike its alternatives such as XML. The framework of JSON is based on 2 structures: the object and the array. An object is a collection of name or value pairs, stored in key-value pairs, where each key correlates with a specific value, while an array is an ordered list of values. Objects are generally used to specify properties of something, whereas arrays are used as a list to hold different values, which could include integers, strings, or even other objects and arrays. Data can be accessed from objects by just calling the key name, whereas, in an array, the data must be called using a number, which represents how far in order of values the wanted value is (JSON, n.d.).</p>
    <p>JSON was made due to a need for a protocol to send information from the server to the browser without using browser plugins in the 2000s. The invention of JSON is widely credited to Douglas Crockford, a cofounder of State Software, who coined the term “JSON”, although Crockford himself has stated that many people had found that JavaScript’s object literals were a good format for object-oriented data and that “[he] made [his] own discovery in April of 2001” (JSON, n.d.). The State Software co-founders created the JSON system and voted on the name JavaScript Object Notation or JSON (Wikipedia, n.d.). Crockford actually intended for JSON to be pronounced like the name Jason, likely due to its similarity, but it is widely pronounced as “JAY-sawn” (Nemeth et al., 2010, 19). The system was sold to Sun Microsystems, Amazon, and EDS, and the JSON.org website was launched in 2002. In 2005, Yahoo began using JSON in its web services. In 2013, Ecma International, a nonprofit organization that standardizes communication and information systems, published its first edition of its JSON standard ECMA-404 (Wikipedia, n.d.).</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, JSON does have some limitations. Unlike its competitors, JSON was developed with a small group of web developers who didn’t account for smooth updates, which has led to many incompatible versions of JSON. On the other hand, its competitors like XML, while more complicated, have reliably been able to update and improve XML, making it a more reliable standard. JSON also does not have a simple solution to handling data when there are multiple objects with the same name, which its competitors, like XML, implement schemas. This can make JSON unreliable for larger corporations or businesses, who may be handling a large amount of data from different sources, who are bound to have some overlaps in naming structure. JSON also doesn’t support the ability to add more base types, which is possible in XML. In general, JSON is well-suited for simple projects, that only require relatively few amounts of objects transferred, rather than for large businesses that handle extremely large amounts of data, that often include custom data types (Priest, 2019).</p>
    <p>JSON is found in my code by identifying classes by using an object so that my code is more organized. My variables in different functions are also categorized like this making them easily accessible throughout the project.</p>
