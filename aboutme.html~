    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Shariq Hasan has been studying Computer Science for 3 years. He has also been involved in his local robotics team. He has a certification in Google Analytics.</p>
    <h1>Why the Digital Portfolio?</h1>
    <p>My digital portfolio is a look into my work and growth over the last 3 years I have spent studying computer science. I have studied the basics of Swift and HTML, while also learning about the functionality of computer science, like the binary and hexadecimal system, logic gates, and early programmers. As I continue to learn, my digital portfolio demonstrates my abilities and what all I am able to accomplish.</p>
